# cc

A new run length encoding algorithm for lossless data compression that exploits positional redundancy by representing data in a two-dimensional model of concentric circles is presented. This visual transform enables detection of runs (each of a different character) in which runs need not be contiguous and hence, is a generalization of run length encoding. Its compression factor is compared with TurboRLE's in the bar chart below.
